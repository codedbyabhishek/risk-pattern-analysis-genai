# Risk Pattern Analysis Using GenAI

**Duration:** Nov 2025 - Feb 2026  
**Type:** Independent Project

## Overview
This project focuses on reducing fraudulent account creation by combining behavioral risk analytics with GenAI-assisted rule design. The objective is to identify repeatable attacker patterns, convert them into practical controls, and support long-term fraud mitigation.

## Key Contributions
- Designed and refined GenAI-assisted rules for long-term mitigation of fraudulent account creation.
- Analyzed behavioral patterns of bad actors (signup flow abuse, device anomalies, velocity spikes, disposable identity signals).
- Produced actionable insights to prioritize fraud prevention controls and risk scoring improvements.
- Worked with engineering-oriented implementation plans for preventive mechanisms across detection and enforcement layers.

## Problem Statement
Fraudulent account creation often evolves faster than static rule systems. This project addresses the gap by pairing pattern mining with GenAI-supported rule generation to improve detection speed and adaptability while reducing false positives.

## Approach
1. Consolidated and normalized behavioral indicators from account creation and early-session events.
2. Clustered abuse patterns to identify high-risk pathways and reusable fraud signatures.
3. Used GenAI to draft candidate detection rules and decision logic from observed patterns.
4. Applied expert review checkpoints to validate precision, explainability, and operational safety.
5. Prioritized controls by impact, implementation effort, and expected fraud reduction.

## Rule Design Framework
- **Behavioral Signals:** velocity, geo inconsistency, device reuse, automation fingerprints, throwaway identity markers.
- **Risk Scoring:** weighted feature strategy with threshold tiers (review, challenge, block).
- **Mitigation Actions:** progressive friction, adaptive verification, temporary hold, hard block.
- **Governance:** rule versioning, rollback plan, and monitoring for drift.

## Outcome Focus
- Faster conversion of observed abuse patterns into deployable controls.
- Improved decision consistency for suspicious account creation attempts.
- Better collaboration between risk analysis and implementation workflows.

## Tech/Methods
- GenAI-assisted rule ideation and pattern summarization
- Behavioral analytics and risk scoring design
- Rule governance principles (versioning, explainability, rollback)
