# Project Summary

## Project
Risk Pattern Analysis Using GenAI (Independent Project)

## Duration
Nov 2025 - Feb 2026

## Objective
Build a practical framework to detect and mitigate fraudulent account creation by translating behavioral abuse patterns into GenAI-assisted risk rules and enforcement actions.

## What Was Done
- Mapped high-risk attacker behavior across registration and early-session activity.
- Built a rule design pipeline that turns behavioral insights into review-ready controls.
- Defined prioritization criteria for implementation: fraud impact, false-positive risk, and engineering effort.
- Documented operational guardrails for production adoption (explainability, versioning, rollback).

## Value Delivered
- Structured, repeatable approach for converting emerging fraud patterns into controls.
- Clear decision logic for when to challenge, review, or block suspicious signups.
- Better alignment model between fraud analytics and engineering implementation.
