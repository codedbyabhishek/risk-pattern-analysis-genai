# Project Summary

## Project
Risk Pattern Analysis Using GenAI (Independent Project)

## Duration
Nov 2025 - Feb 2026

## One-Line Description
Developed a GenAI-assisted risk analysis framework to detect and mitigate fraudulent account creation using behavioral pattern intelligence.

## Context
Fraudulent account creation is a high-frequency attack vector that can lead to promo abuse, spam operations, and downstream financial fraud. Static rule sets often fail to keep pace with changing attacker tactics.

## Objective
Create a repeatable process that transforms observed attacker behavior into production-ready preventive controls while maintaining explainability and operational safety.

## Work Completed
- Mapped and normalized signup and early-session risk signals.
- Identified repeat abuse patterns (velocity, device reuse, geo mismatch, synthetic identity markers).
- Used GenAI to draft candidate risk rules and policy logic.
- Added expert review checkpoints to calibrate thresholds and reduce false positives.
- Produced implementation-oriented guidance for engineering teams, including rollout and rollback criteria.

## Core Outputs
- Fraud behavior taxonomy for account creation abuse.
- Rule design framework with enforcement tiers (monitor, challenge, review, block).
- Prioritization model balancing impact, risk, and engineering effort.
- Governance approach covering versioning, monitoring, and drift management.

## Professional Value
This project shows end-to-end capability in fraud analytics, GenAI-assisted rule generation, and cross-functional operationalization of preventive controls.
