## Primary Version (Recommended)
**Risk Pattern Analysis Using GenAI, Independent Project | Nov 2025 - Feb 2026**
- Built a GenAI-assisted framework to convert fraudulent account creation patterns into deployable risk rules.
- Analyzed bad-actor behavior across signup and early-session signals to identify high-risk indicators and abuse pathways.
- Produced engineering-ready preventive control specifications with threshold tiers, review logic, and rollout guardrails.

## Strong Technical Variant
- Designed behavioral risk scoring logic using velocity, device/network anomalies, and identity-quality signals.
- Generated and refined rule candidates with GenAI, then calibrated decision thresholds to balance detection and false positives.
- Documented governance model for rule lifecycle management: explainability, versioning, monitoring, and rollback.

## ATS-Friendly Variant
- Fraud Detection
- Risk Analytics
- GenAI for Security
- Behavioral Pattern Analysis
- Rule Engine Design
- Account Creation Abuse Prevention
- Cross-Functional Collaboration

### ATS Bullets
- Developed GenAI-assisted fraud detection rules for account creation abuse mitigation.
- Performed behavioral analysis to identify suspicious signup patterns and risk signals.
- Collaborated with engineering-oriented workflows to operationalize preventive fraud controls.
